## Welcome!

My name is Josh, and I'm currently pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology through its OMSCS program. My aim is to apply math- and science-based theory to software in areas such as computer graphics and machine learning. 

I am actively seeking entry level or internship roles in software engineering.

Previously, I earned a B.S. in Chemical Engineering from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Upon graduating, I worked at Takeda, a major pharmaceutical company, in multiple technical operations roles, the longest and most recent of which was as an Automation Engineer.
